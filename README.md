# Path Tracking
2020-2021 Capstone Project, exploring various path tracking algorithms and their efficacy when applied to a small autonomous robot of VEX Robotics parts.

### Abstract
Path tracking is a specific problem within the field of controls engineering that seeks to devise methods of following a path with an autonomous robot. There are many variants of path tracking algorithms that have been designed for different types of vehicles. This paper will explore various methods of path tracking as applied to a small skid-steer robotic vehicle constructed from VEX Robotics parts, as well as present and analyze data regarding the algorithms' performance.
