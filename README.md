# Path Tracking
2020-2021 Capstone Project, exploring various path tracking algorithms and their efficacy when applied to a small autonomous robot of VEX Robotics parts.

### Abstract
Path tracking is a specific problem within the field of controls engineering that seeks to devise methods of following a path with an autonomous robot. There are many variations of path tracking that have been designed for different vehicles. This paper will give an overview of the process of path tracking and explore various algorithms used for path tracking, as well as some variations using adaptable parameters. Thereafter, the algorithms and their variations will be tested using a small skid-steer robotic vehicle constructed from VEX Robotics parts. Telemetry data from these tests is used to assess each algorithm's performance, and this data is analyzed to suggest future improvements.
